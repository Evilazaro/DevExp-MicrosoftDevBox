## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you are expected to uphold our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please ensure you read and understand its contents.

## Getting Started

* Fork the [repository](https://github.com/Evilazaro/MicrosoftDevBox) on GitHub.
* Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
* Set up the required development environment.
* Check out the [issues](https://github.com/Evilazaro/MicrosoftDevBox/issues) to see what we need help with.

## How to Contribute

1. **Find an Issue** - Look for open issues or create your own issue. This helps avoid duplicating efforts as someone else might be working on the same issue.
2. **Fork & Clone** - Fork the repo and then clone your fork. This is essential for you to make and test your changes.
3. **Branch** - Create a new branch based on `main` (or whatever is the primary development branch). Please use a descriptive name for your branch.
4. **Make Changes** - Make your changes and ensure you stick to the [Style Guide](#style-guide).
5. **Test** - Ensure your changes do not break any existing functionality. Add new tests if necessary.
6. **Commit** - Use descriptive commit messages and follow the [Commit Messages](#commit-messages) guidelines.
7. **Push & Pull Request** - Push your changes to your forked repository and then submit a Pull Request with a detailed description of the changes.

## Style Guide

* Ensure your code respects the existing coding style.
* Comment your code. Especially when using non-trivial solutions.
* If the project uses linting or a formatter, make sure your changes do not produce any warnings.

## Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
* Start the commit message with an applicable emoji:
    * 🎉 Initial commit
    * 🐛 Fixing a bug
    * ✨ New feature
    * 📝 Documentation changes
    * ... (you can expand based on your needs)

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your PR has a descriptive name.
2. Add a comprehensive description detailing what changes you've made.
3. Reference the issue(s) your PR solves.
4. Ensure all checks and tests pass.
5. A maintainer will review and potentially suggest changes. Work on these changes, and push them to your fork.
6. Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR.

## Additional Notes

* For major changes or features, please open an issue first to discuss your idea.
* If you have questions or need help, reach out to the maintainers or the community.
